Design:
- [DONE] R3.0 PCB design
- [DONE+ORDERED] R3.0 panel design

Proto build:
- Procure all parts / shuffle PN#s
    - [DONE] pre-order AK4619VN
    - [DONE] Find better 0402 LEDs
    - [DONE] Add header pins
- [PENDING PARTS] Manufacture 3x units @ CM

Bringup / Validate:
- Add driver for Jackdetect / LEDs / Cal mem
    - Probably only LEDs need to be final for proof-of-concept.
    - Can poke rest from non-FPGA land.
- De-risk changes:
    - Check cross-talk (between channels and LEDs)
    - Check calibration over wider voltage ranges
    - Check LEDs / Jackdet / Calmem works

Production build (batch1):
- Procure all PCBA parts
- Manufacture 25x units (or more)

Test & cal:
