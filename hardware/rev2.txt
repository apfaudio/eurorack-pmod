Changes for 'eurorack-pmod' Revision 2:

Required:
    - DFM (Intent: PCBWay assembly (JLC doesn't have parts...)
        - Overall more cheap
        - Overall more beautiful
        - Every part (?) needs to be fetchable by PCBWay
    - Remove unnecessary connector
    - Collate Op-amps into TL074
        - Resistor arrays
    - Combine PMOD I2C and I2S standard pinouts
    - 10pin power?
    - Jacks -> Thonkiconn?
    - Split SMD + Non-SMD parts?
        - Separate board with all SMD parts :D

Nice to have:
    - I2C bus expansion connector
    - Visual LED feedback
    - Plug detect
    - Calibration solution
        - Or no solution, just add instructions :D

Next revision:
    - Combine FPGA with device
    - Or just design 'FPGA host' module!
        - Distributed version could just share front panel...
